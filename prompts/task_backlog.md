# User Story Task Breakdown Template

## Purpose
Transform user stories into granular, sprint-ready tasks that deliver incremental value to end users while enabling effective progress tracking.

## Input Requirements
For each user story, provide:
- User story ID and title
- User story description
- Acceptance criteria
- Any technical constraints or dependencies

## Task Breakdown Guidelines
1. Break down tasks to be completable within 1-2 days
2. Each task should:
   - Deliver measurable value
   - Be independently testable
   - Have clear completion criteria
   - Be estimable with reasonable confidence

## Task Categories to Consider
- UI/UX Development
- Backend Development
- Database Operations
- API Development
- Testing & Quality Assurance
- Documentation
- Security & Compliance
- Infrastructure & DevOps
- Research & Analysis

## Output Format
Present tasks in a table with the following structure:

| Task ID | Task Description | Estimated Effort (hours) | Priority | Requires Code |
|---------|-----------------|------------------------|-----------|---------------|
| [category]-[number] | Specific, actionable description | 1-16 | High/Medium/Low | Yes/No |

### Task ID Format
- UI-# for user interface tasks
- BE-# for backend tasks
- API-# for API-related tasks
- DB-# for database tasks
- TEST-# for testing tasks
- DOC-# for documentation tasks
- SEC-# for security tasks
- INF-# for infrastructure tasks
- RES-# for research tasks

### Priority Levels
- High: Critical path, blocking other work
- Medium: Important but not blocking
- Low: Nice to have, can be deferred

## Example Output

### User Story: Implement User Authentication

| Task ID | Task Description | Estimated Effort (hours) | Priority | Requires Code |
|---------|-----------------|------------------------|-----------|---------------|
| UI-1 | Design login form with email/password fields | 4 | High | Yes |
| UI-2 | Implement form validation and error displays | 3 | High | Yes |
| BE-1 | Implement JWT token generation and validation | 6 | High | Yes |
| API-1 | Create authentication API endpoints | 4 | High | Yes |
| DB-1 | Design user credentials schema | 2 | High | No |
| TEST-1 | Write unit tests for authentication logic | 4 | Medium | Yes |
| SEC-1 | Implement password hashing and security measures | 4 | High | Yes |
| DOC-1 | Document authentication flow and API endpoints | 2 | Medium | No |

## Review Checklist
