Please analyze the provided friction log and convert the feedback into actionable user stories. Present them in a structured table format with the following columns:

| Priority | User Story | Pain Point | Proposed Solution | Complexity | Business Value |

Guidelines for creating user stories:
1. Format each user story as: "As a [user type], I want to [specific action] so that [clear benefit]"
2. Prioritize stories using these criteria:
   - Critical: Severely impacts core functionality/business
   - High: Significantly affects user experience
   - Medium: Important but not urgent
   - Low: Nice to have

For each user story, please include:
- A clear description of the current pain point from the friction log
- A specific, actionable solution recommendation
- Estimated complexity (Simple/Medium/Complex)
- Business value (High/Medium/Low)

Example:
| Priority | User Story | Pain Point | Proposed Solution | Complexity | Business Value |
| -------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------------- | ---------- | -------------- |
| Critical | As a customer, I want to refill prescriptions with one click so that I can save time | Users must navigate through order history to find and refill prescriptions | Add "Quick Refill" button to dashboard and order details pages | Simple | High |

Additional Requirements:
1. Group similar friction points into single user stories where appropriate
2. Focus on actionable improvements rather than vague suggestions
3. Consider technical feasibility in solution recommendations
4. Include acceptance criteria for each user story
